### Use NAVFITOnline at **[https://navfit99.github.io](https://navfit99.github.io)**. 

#### Master repository for issues and pull requests located at [ansonl/navfit99-js](https://github.com/ansonl/navfit99-js).  ***[navfit99/navfit99.github.io](https://navfit99.github.io)* is the public gh-pages release of *ansonl/navfit99-js* for URL path reasons. ** 

##### Part of NAVFITOnline project: [client-cert-auth](https://github.com/ansonl/client-cert-auth), [navfit99-js](https://github.com/ansonl/navfit99-js), and [navfit99-server](https://github.com/ansonl/navfit99-server)

#### The CAC login demo server is hosted on a personal VM and likely be down due to restarts, etc ~~bears~~. *Recommend you run [client-cert-auth](https://github.com/ansonl/client-cert-auth) on your own machine and change `authBaseURL` (explained in Step #3 in instructions below) to run your own CAC login server.*

### What is NAVFITOnline?
NAVFITOnline is an open source project that allows you to view and edit NAVFIT98A database (.accdb) files. The provided [GitHub pages version of the webapp](https://navfit99.github.io) uses a publicly accessible server on the internet for functionality. This server is intended for demo purposes only. 

Users that may find this helpful include:
- Apple Mac OSX users
- Linux users
- Windows users unable to install MSAccess drivers or NAVFIT98A

NAVFITOnline's development name in parts of the codebase is NAVFIT99.

### Features of NAVFITOnline
- Import NAVFIT database *accdb* files used by NAVFIT98A. 
- Create new NAVFIT database files.
- **View Folders' Reports** in NAVFIT database.
- **View and Edit Reports** in NAVFIT database.
  - **Move Reports** to different Folders (not available in NAVFIT98A)
- **View and Edit entire NAVFIT database** in [JSON](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/JavaScript/Objects/JSON) (not available in NAVFIT98A).
- **CAC enabled login** through web browser to keep track of user NAVFITs. 
  - Public [https://navfit99.github.io](https://navfit99.github.io) site currently set to accept DoD CAC only. 

#### Future to-dos for NAVFITOnline (aka: Not features of NAVFITOnline)
- View Folders [template] content data. (Implemented on server side already.)
- Move Folders to different Folders. 
- Update Member Trait Group Average and Summary Group Average. 
 
#### Security of NAVFITOnline public demo site [https://navfit99.github.io](https://navfit99.github.io)
- NAVFIT data is encrypted using [AES](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advanced_Encryption_Standard) and a 128 bit secret key kept on the server as an environment variable. 
- **Encrypted NAVFIT data are stored on a publicly accessible Redis database.**
- User authentication tokens are stored as [SHA256](https://csrc.nist.gov/csrc/media/publications/fips/180/4/final/documents/fips180-4-draft-aug2014.pdf) hashes.
-  **Hashed user authentication tokens are stored on a publicly accessible Redis database.**
- User authentication tokens are passed back to the browser as GET parameters. 
- Certificate revovation checking is turned off. 
-  **The decision to use a publicly accessible database for storage was made to balance the cost of running the public demo server backend (navfit99-server) on Heroku.** As with all protected data, there is always the possibility of an exploit or brute force attack to decrypt data. 
- Demo NAVFIT-server has a 1 week expiration for saved NAVFITs. Editing a NAVFIT will reset the expiration to be 1 week from the time to latest edit.

#### Steps to host your own NAVFITOnline:

1. Install a web browser. *Tested in Chrome, but should be compatible with most browsers.* 
2. Get code with `git clone https://github.com/ansonl/navfit99-js.git` or use *Clone or download* button above.
3.  If desired, change `backendBaseURL` and `authBaseURL` in `js/constants.js` to point to your own instances of [navfit99-server](https://github.com/ansonl/navfit99-server) and [client-cert-auth](https://github.com/ansonl/client-cert-auth). 
  - See other project repos for specific setup directions.
4. Drag to a web accessible directory on your computer. 
5. Start web server and browse to `index.html` location to using NAVFITOnline. 
  - You can create a quick web server by starting command line (Windows+X) or terminal, navigating to the project directory (cd), and running `python -m http.server 8080`. (Requires Python). Visit `localhost:8080` to use the web app.
